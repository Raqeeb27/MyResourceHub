# How to Enable Virtualization in BIOS or UEFI Firmware

## Step 1: Enter your BIOS or UEFI Firmware Settings
1. Restart your computer.
2. As it boots up, press the key that opens the BIOS setup. Common keys include **F1**, **F2**, **Del**, **Esc**, or **F10** (this may vary by manufacturer).
3. Refer to your computer's manual or look for on-screen prompts to confirm the correct key.

## Step 2: Navigate to CPU-Related Settings
1. Once inside the BIOS, navigate to sections labeled **Advanced**, **Processor**, or **CPU Configuration**.
2. Note that in most BIOS menus, the mouse is disabled, so use the keyboard for navigation.

## Step 3: Locate the Virtualization Settings
1. In the CPU-related section, look for options such as **Intel Virtualization Technology**, **VT-x**, **AMD-V**, **SVM**, or simply **Virtualization**.
2. The available settings may vary depending on whether you have an Intel or AMD processor.

## Step 4: Enable Virtualization
1. Change the setting from **Disabled** to **Enabled**.
2. If there are multiple virtualization options (like **VT-d**), consult your CPU documentation for guidance on which features to enable.

## Step 5: Save and Exit
1. To save the changes, press the **F10** key or navigate to an exit option where you can select to save and exit.
2. Confirm your choice when prompted to save the changes.

## Step 6: Reboot Your Computer
1. After saving the changes, let your computer reboot normally.
2. Your system is now ready for tasks such as running virtual machines or hypervisors.

By following these steps, you've successfully enabled virtualization in the BIOS!
